# Cataract Detection using Inception Pretrained Model

This repository contains an implementation of cataract detection using an Inception pretrained model. The goal of this project is to provide an accurate and automated system for identifying cataracts in medical images.

## Features
- Utilizes a pretrained Inception model for efficient and accurate cataract detection.
- Provides a user-friendly interface for inputting and processing cataract images.
- Outputs the results of cataract detection.
- Enables easy integration into existing healthcare systems or research projects.

## Dataset
To train the Inception model, I used a dataset of cataract images. The dataset consists of both normal and affected eye images. Due to privacy and licensing restrictions, the dataset cannot be included in this repository.
